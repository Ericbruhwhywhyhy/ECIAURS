## Eric's Chicken Invaders Assets Unpacking and Repacking script

abbreviated to ECIAURS for shot (yeah the name sucks) this minimal python script let you mod Chicken Invaders Universe or Chicken Invaders Episodes versions from December 2024 onwards

## NOTE:

this project is NOT endorsed by or affilliated with Interaction Studios in anyway.

by using this, you have achknowledged your responsibility to your game or game files. There will be no support if anything broke (unless if it's mod script related in which case contact me)

do NOT redistribute your game file (that is your .222x/.122x file) at the request of Interaction Studios themselves.

if you want to look into texture modding, TGATool will help you as the game uses proprietary .tga format that can only be editable through conversion: https://github.com/VerMishelb/TGATool
## RESOURCES
